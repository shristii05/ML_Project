# 🤖 ML Model Comparison Project

This repository demonstrates the implementation and comparison of several fundamental machine learning algorithms on different real-world datasets. The goal is to evaluate their performance and understand which models are best suited for particular types of data and problems.

## 📚 Project Overview

Machine learning models behave differently depending on the type of data, its features, and the problem (classification or regression). In this project, we:

- Explore and preprocess multiple datasets.
- Implement key ML models using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
- Compare results to determine which model performs best in each scenario.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

1. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem.
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees using bagging.
3. **Decision Tree** - Tree-based flowchart for decision making.
4. **Linear Regression** - Predicts continuous values based on linear relationships.
5. **Logistic Regression** - Predicts binary/class labels using a sigmoid function.
6. **Ensemble Learning** - Combines multiple models to improve predictions (Voting, Bagging, Boosting).
